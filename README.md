# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing

# Introduction:
## Mercedes-Benz, commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926.
## To ensure the safety and reliability of each and every unique car configuration, robust testing system was developed.
## It consists of permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing.
## Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler’s standards.

# Conclusion:
## R² = 0.94 indicates a high level of correlation between our model's predictions and the actual values.¶
## MSE= 9.23 indicates that model has good prediction accuracy if testing time are high and suggest that there is room for improvement if testing time are lower.
## Reduction in testing time will reduce the carbon emissions and hence beneficial to the environment.
## Similar models can be used for other automotive manufacturing companies for a sustainable industry practices.
